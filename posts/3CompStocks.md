The computer hardware industry is dealing with the ramifications of a sell-off of technology stocks, which marked the end of its stellar rally over the past year. However, the continued adoption of a remote (and hybrid) working culture should allow the computer hardware industry to deliver solid revenues and earnings in the coming quarters. Furthermore, the ongoing 5G deployment is contributing significantly the rising demand for upgraded computer hardware that is compatible with the next-generation network.

The tech-sell off is expected to be short lived, providing investors perfect entry points in computer hardware stocks with solid growth potential.

As such, we think Logitech International S.A. (LOGI), NetApp, Inc. (NTAP), and Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) are expected to deliver solid returns in the coming months.
