title: Goodbye Greek Alphabet Hurricanes - Hello Names With Q or Z?

The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was only the second year in which the Greek alphabet had to be used to name storms. The first year was 2005. The Greek alphabet is used when the annual name list is completed. The year 2020 featured 30 named storms and reached Iota. However, questions were raised about what happens if a Greek letter-named storm needs to be retired or if the entire alphabet is consumed. I previously discussed proposals for using a supplemental list in a previous article in Forbes. This week, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) retired the use of the Greek alphabet going forward as well as few storm names from the 2020 season.

According to a press release, the Hurricane Committee of the WMO, which features members from national meteorological and hydrological services, determined that, “the Greek alphabet will not be used in future because it creates a distraction from the communication of hazard and storm warnings and is potentially confusing.” The same press release also announced the retirement of Dorian (2019) and Laura, Eta and Iota (2020). Storm names are retired from the 6-year rotating lists if they cause very significant damage and/or deaths.

In November, well-known meteorologist Nate Johnson tweeted a provocative idea. Johnson is no stranger to the weather community. He is the Director of Weather Operations for NBCUniversal Owned TV Stations, the current president of the National Weather Association (NWA), and a part of the legendary Podcast WeatherBrains. While he was speaking as an individual (and not from any organizational perspective), his ideas resonated with me. In a nutshell, he argued (and maybe others had too) for using a system similar to what is done in some other basins (including the Western North Pacific, Central North Pacific, South China Sea). They use multiple lists with names in sequential order. He also advocated that the names be picked up at the beginning of the next year rather than resetting.

Here’s the new process announced by the WMO and features some aspects similar to what Johnson tweeted:
A supplemental list of names A-Z (excluding Q, U, as well as X, Y, and Z on the Atlantic list) will be created
Names on that list could be retired and replaced as needed.

Ultimately, the WMO committee was concerned about the challenge of retiring a Greek letter names; the pronunciation issues when they are translated to other languages; the similarity of certain Greek letters like Eta, Theta, Zeta; and the focus by the media and other messengers on the Greek letters rather than the storm impacts.

While they won’t be on the main 6-year rotating name lists, if your name begins with a Q, U, X, Y and Z then you may see it on the supplemental lists.
